I've been building things with computers for as long as I can remember and am fascinated with how things work. I'm the Founder and CTO of [Bolt](https://www.learnwithbolt.com), a company with the goal of democratizing SAT preparation. I am also finishing my final year at Stevens Institute of Technology and interning for NBCUniversal on the On-Air Engineering team. In my spare time, I build websites and iOS applications, take pictures, and explore Hoboken by bike.

You can find me in the corner of a coffee shop building something new or writing something for my [blog](/blog.html) (which I've been meaning to do more). If you have a project you think would be of interest, please don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:phil@fishbe.in), I'd love to help.
